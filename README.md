As they say “Out of sight, out of mind”, this is the current
situation with age-old artifacts.

These artifacts made by few families, generally living in various villages all over India, hold ethnic values but sadly somewhere among the city lights and our busy lives, these heritage beauties have become invisible to us.

This has led to loss of earning for the families who do not have the means to promote them to the wider market
and even if they are able to sell their products, but unfortunately, they are somewhere exploited by the so-called middle men who tend to keep the lion share of the profit.

To tackle this issue we have come forward with a web platform that gives the urban people access to
these artifacts easily and makes it easier for us to buy these products which in turn benefits the tribal and rural craftsmen as they can now sell their products world wide with our website.
