                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    <p><b>Saksham</b> was born when <i>Shreya</i>, one day in 2020 was sitting in front of TV lazily and randomly surfing
                        across various channels and suddenly came across some news channel, where a certain a headline
                        caught her attention. On the screen there was a rural area scene playing and the reporter was heard
                        saying how artsmen are suffering nowadays without any means of selling their artswork, resulting in no
                        ways of earning and in order to earn their living, they are taking up other jobs, eventually leaving behind.
                    </p>
                    <p>It struck a chord in her mind, and since she was a <i>budding engineer</i>, she decided to take it up as a
                    problem and strive to solve it. She immediately came up with a rough idea and contacted her friends                <i>Ban</i> &amp; <i>Khush</i>. After hearing everything they took it up as a challenge to come forward and solve this
                    problem which threatened our countryâ€™s heritage &amp; precious cultural arts.</p>

                    <p><i>"Saksham is our eager effort to protect our centuries old artworks and revive those that have been lost."</i></p>
<p>
At Saksham we, collaborate with arts men through <b>NGOs and student volunteers</b> to get their artwork
and make it visible to urbanites, worldwide. You can visit our site and see the displayed products, buy
them, donate, collaborate with us for exhibitions and sign up yourself for learning any art you want, to
learn from their experts directly as we also conduct workshops. We would really appreciate if you join
our group for this noble effort and carry forward the legacy of our rich cultural heritage.</p>
